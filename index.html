			<p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. Elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool, but sometimes the heat is too much. Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves. Afterwards, they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust.</p>
